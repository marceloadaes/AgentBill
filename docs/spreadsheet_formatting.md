# Spreadsheet Formatting

These guidelines explain how the Google Sheet **Agent Bill -- Controle de Contas** should be formatted.

## Adding the Agent Bill title
1. In cell `A1` of the first sheet enter the text **Agent Bill**.
2. Set the font size to **40** and make it **bold**.
3. Do not merge any cells when adding the title.

## Formatting the header row
When the first bill is inserted the header row should be styled for readability:

- Set the background color of the header to `#2c3e50`, the same color as the application's menu bar.
- Make the header text white and bold.

These steps ensure the spreadsheet matches the look and feel of Agent Bill.
